# React Query Project

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of React Query to simplify data fetching, caching, and updating in React applications. It covers various techniques, including caching, mutations, infinite queries, paginated queries, parameterized queries, and optimistic updates.

## Features
- **Caching**: Efficiently cache data to improve performance and reduce server load.
- **Mutations**: Update data and sync it with the server using `useMutation`.
- **Infinite Queries**: Fetch endless data sets in a seamless manner.
- **Paginated Queries**: Retrieve paginated data for improved performance.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use parameters to fetch specific data.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Enhance user experience with instant updates.
- **DevTools**: Inspect and debug queries with React Query DevTools.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Query**: Library for fetching, caching, and updating data.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests.
- **Zod**: Schema validation for form handling.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for building the application.
