# WebSockets: Enhancing Real-time Communication for Web Applications with Socket.IO

## Overview
This repo demonstrates the use of WebSockets with Socket.IO to create a robust and real-time communication system. The projects includes the following key applications:
1. Two simple connection demo apps.
2. A multiplayer dashboard app.
3. A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

## Features
- **Real-time Communication**: Instantly updates data across all clients connected to the server using WebSockets.
- **Multiplayer Functionality**: Engages multiple users simultaneously in the dashboard application.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full capability for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data entries in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.IO**: Library enabling real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling for the front-end application.
