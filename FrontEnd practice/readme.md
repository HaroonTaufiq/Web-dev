## Overview
This repo showcases various concepts and techniques implemented in React.js projects.

## Getting Started
### Key Concepts:
- **Components**: The building blocks of the React application.
- **JavaScript Framework**: Utilizing the React framework.
- **JavaScript Library**: Leveraging third-party libraries to enhance functionality.
- **JSX**: Using JavaScript XML to describe the UI components.
- **DOM**: Interacting with the Document Object Model.
- **Virtual DOM**: Enhancing performance with React's virtual DOM.

## Building Components
### Techniques:
- **Fragment**: Utilizing `<React.Fragment>` to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes.
- **Immutable Props**: Ensuring props are immutable to maintain component integrity.
- **State Hook**: Managing local component state with `useState`.

## Styling Components
### Approaches:
- **CSS-in-JS**: Styling components using libraries like styled-components.
- **CSS Modules**: Modular and locally scoped CSS.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Interface**: Designing user-friendly interfaces.
  - **Inline Styles**: Applying styles directly in the JSX.
  - **Modular**: Keeping styles modular and reusable.
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Ensuring a clear separation between styling and logic.
  - **Vanilla CSS**: Using traditional CSS for simplicity.

## Managing Component State
### Practices:
- **Asynchronous**: Handling async state updates.
- **Lifting State**: Lifting state up to common ancestors to share it among components.
- **Pure Component**: Optimizing rendering with pure components.
- **Strict Mode**: Enabling React's strict mode to identify potential problems.

## Building Forms
### Tools:
- **React Hook Form**: Simplifying form handling with React Hook Form.
- **Ref Hook**: Using `useRef` for accessing DOM elements directly.
- **Schema-based Validation**: Implementing validation with libraries like Zod.

## Connecting to the Backend
### Techniques:
- **Axios**: Making HTTP requests with Axios.
- **HTTP**:
  - **Back-end**: Communicating with the backend server.
  - **HTTP Request**: Making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
  - **Effect Hook**: Managing side effects with `useEffect`.
  - **HTTP Response**: Handling server responses.
  - **Side Effects**: Performing side effects safely.
  - **Try Catch**: Error handling with try-catch blocks.
  - **Async Await**: Managing asynchronous code with async-await.
  - **Custom Hooks**: Creating custom hooks for reusable logic.
